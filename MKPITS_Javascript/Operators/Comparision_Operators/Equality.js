//The Comparison Equality Operator is used to compare the values of the operand.
//The comparison operator returns true only if the value of two operands are equal otherwise it returns false.

//Syntax:
//a==b
//Note: The equality comparison is symmetric in the sense that a==b is the same as b==a.

// we will use the equality operator on the same data types.

let a = 1;
let b = 1;
let c = new String("Hello");
let d = new String("Hello");
let e = "Hello";
console.log(a == b); //true
console.log(c == d); //false
console.log(c == e); //true
