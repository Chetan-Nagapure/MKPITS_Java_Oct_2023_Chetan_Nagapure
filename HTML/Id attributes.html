      Since the lack of a collection framework gave rise to the above set of
      disadvantages, the following are the advantages of the collection
      framework.<br />
      Consistent API: The API has a basic set of interfaces like Collection,
      Set, List, or Map, all the classes (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, etc)
      that implement these interfaces have some common set of methods.
      <br />Reduces programming effort: A programmer doesn’t have to worry about
      the design of the Collection but rather he can focus on its best use in
      his program. Therefore, the basic concept of Object-oriented programming
      (i.e.) abstraction has been successfully implemented. <br />
      Increases program speed and quality: Increases performance by providing
      high-performance implementations of useful data structures and algorithms
      because in this case, the programmer need not think of the best
      implementation of a specific data structure. He can simply use the best
      implementation to drastically boost the performance of his
      algorithm/program.
